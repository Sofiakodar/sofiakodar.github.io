I love books. I usually read 30–55 books a year. It's usually a mix between non-fiction and work related books: leadership, neuroscience, communication and engineering, and books just for fun, mostly fantasy and science-fiction. 

Last year I read (and finished) 36+ books, mostly fantasy, since I decided to get my mind off work more during my free time. 
My favorite work related book last year was **Supercommunicators** by Charles Duhigg. I found it interesting and a good reminder of what to think about when having conversations. I often tell my colleagues that what *you say* and the other person *hears*, can be two very different things. Charles Duhigg also describes how two people might be in the same conversation but with completely different goals and view of what the conversation is about. Is it a conversation where you’re trying to solve a problem and come up with actions, or just vent and rant? 

## My current book pile

These are the books I've bought that are laying next to my desk, that I will read the next few months: 
- Strong Ground – Brené Brown (I've enjoyed her previous books, so I'm excited).
- Trust and Inspire – Stephen M R Covey (seems like a modern follow up to Speed of Trust).
- Go put your strengths to work – Marcus Buckingham (both books by Marcus Buckingham are about strength-based development which I have strongly believed in as long as I can remember, long before I knew about the research and the strength based movement).
- The one thing you need to know – Marcus Buckingham. 
- An Elegant puzzle, systems of Engineering management – Will Larson (from a book club).
- The Software Engineer’s guidebook – Gergely Orosz (from a book club).
- Tomorrowmind – Gabriella Rosen Kellerman, Martin Seligman (I've very much enjoyed Martin Seligmans books and talks on Positive Psychology, so looking forward to this one).
- Dealing with Feeling – Marc Brackett (Not only work related but important when working with humans).


## Favorite books

I have a lot of favorite books, but if I would name a few books about leadership and had to choose I would say: 
- Daring greatly – Brené Brown. I really like Brené Browns research into vulnerability and even though she's written other books more specifically about leadership, I think her first book about vulnerability is the best so far.
- The Coaching Habit – Michael Bungay Stanier. Usually one of the first books I recommend to new Engineering managers. This book gives advice on how to have productive 1-1:s and enable your direct reports. 
- Speed of trust - Stephen M.R Covey. This book is about building trust first in yourself, and then among your colleagues and the whole organisation. 
- Switch - Chip Heath, Dan Heath. This is one of the first books I read about change management and it made a big impression on me as a quite junior team lead. 
- The Manager's path - Camille Fournier. Another good book for Engineering managers, especially those who take the step from senior engineer/tech lead. Explains different levels of leadership and how to prioritize. 
- Becoming a technical leader - Gerald M Weinberg. A classic. About different leadership styles, problem solving, self-awareness, motivating others and much more. 
- Helping - Edgar H. Schein. Lots of interesting thoughts around what it means to help and coach people and organisations. I hesitated to put it on the list, since it's quite dry and not super engaging, but the material is still valuable and it's a classic for a reason.

I have so many more books in my book shelves but these are the ones I chose for now. Do you have some books you would recommend?
